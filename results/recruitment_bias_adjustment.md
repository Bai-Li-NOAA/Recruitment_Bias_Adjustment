Recruitment Bias Adjustment
================

------------------------------------------------------
1. Geometric and arithmetic mean curves of recruitment

Median-unbiased unfished recruitment: 1000000 number of fish\
Median-unbiased steepness: 0.75\
Spawning biomass per recruit: 0.01025625\
Standard deviation of log recruitment: 0.6

2. Parameters associated with geometric and arithmetic mean curves of recruitment

Calculate corresponding mean-unbiased steepness given a fixed median-unbiased steepness and sigmaR:
